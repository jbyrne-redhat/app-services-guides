[role="_abstract"]Reuse test. The application in this quick start uses a Kafka topic called `{topic-name}` to produce and consume messages. In this task, you'll create the `{topic-name}` topic in your Kafka instance.

.Prerequisites
* You have a running Kafka instance in {product-long-kafka}.

.Procedure
. In the {product-kafka} {service-url-kafka}[web console^], select *Kafka Instances* and then click the name of the Kafka instance that you want to add a topic to.
. Select the *Topics* tab.
. Click *Create topic* and follow the guided steps to define the topic details.

You must specify the following topic properties:

* *Topic name*: For this quick start, enter `{topic-name}` as the topic name.
* *Partitions*: Set the number of partitions for the topic. For this quick start, set the value to `1`.
* *Message retention*: Set the message retention time and size. For this quick start, set the retention time to `A week` and the retention size to `Unlimited`.
* *Replicas*: For this release of {product-kafka}, the replica values are preconfigured. The number of partition replicas for the topic is set to `3` and the minimum number of follower replicas that must be in sync with a partition leader is set to `2`. For a trial Kafka instance, the number of replicas and the minimum in-sync replica factor are both set to `1`.

After you complete the setup, the new topic appears on the *Topics* page. You can now run the application to start producing and consuming messages.
